# arch-de-install

Hello everyone,
I was able to do the first archlinux installation with the archdi script. I try to learn something about programming in my spare time. I organized Archdi according to the programs I use. Of course, I may have made some mistakes, I just created this project for my own personal use and learning purposes.

Thank you MatMoul.
