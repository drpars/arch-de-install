# arch-de-install

Hello everyone,
A few years ago, I was able to do the first archlinux installation with the archdi script. I try to learning something about programming in my free time. I edited Archdi according to the programs I use. Of course, I may have made some mistakes, I just created this project for learning purposes.

Thank you MatMoul.
